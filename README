XSLT-Typograf


ABOUT

XSLT-Typograf is a simple tool for typographical pre-processing of the text,
implemented in pure XSLT. It could be useful in documentation processing and
formatting tools, wich produces documents in any format (pdf, html, odf, etc.)

Current version based on the rules for the russian text typography, but it
could be easily modified to support any other rules.


USAGE

The simplest way to use this: just to import the only stylesheet
(`src/xslt/typography.xsl`) to any of your stylesheets and... that's all.
Currently it has some basic customization abilities, but their description
will appear in a nearest feature. So if you need such tuning -
please, do it in any way you wish.
